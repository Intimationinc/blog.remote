Security experts have cautioned against relying on SMS messages for two-factor authentication due to their susceptibility to interception or compromise. Recently, a security researcher uncovered a concerning revelation: an unprotected database online housing millions of such authentication codes.

The database, discovered by researcher Anurag Sen, lacked any password protection despite being accessible on the internet. Essentially, anyone with knowledge of the database's IP address could easily navigate to it using a standard web browser.

While the ownership of the exposed database initially remained unclear, investigative efforts led to the discovery that YX International, an Asian firm offering SMS text message routing services, was responsible. Upon being alerted by TechCrunch reporters, YX International promptly secured the database.
